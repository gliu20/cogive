		<h2>Production</h2>
		<h3>Making PPE can be easily done with a 3D-printer. You can find extensive guidence and assistance by contacting us, or searching on Youtube</h3>

		<h2>Face Shields</h2>
			<h3>-They are used to protect the facial area and allow for greater reusability of face masks like the N95 mask. This is a recommended item, mainly because there arenâ€™t complex regulations, and most facilities are in need of this protection.</h3>
			<h3>-There should be enough space between the clear shield and face. This would allow for masks to be worn underneath.</h3>
			<h3>-Shields must have a top hood/cover to protect from falling droplets. </h3>
		<h2>Sanitization</h2>
			<h3>-When handling materials, clean your hands with soap and water. If possible, wear gloves when sanitizing PPE.</h3>
			<h3>-Wipe down with alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol and leave on the surface for at least 30 seconds.</h3>
			<h3>To ensure that PPE is produced safely, we encourage students to follow FDA regulations. All materials should be sanitized.
